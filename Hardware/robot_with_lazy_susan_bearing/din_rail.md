## Introduction

The din rail (DT) consists of a holed metal with some terminal blocks (red & white) attached on it. You can attach as many as you wish, and its purpose is provide some convience while wiring the battery.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. Attach the terminal blocks and the circuit breaker (E2) on the (DT). They 'click' if fitted properly, and they freely move along the rail.

2. Fit in-place 2 (T4) nuts on the extrusion that will accommodate the din rail and screw the rail on them using (N3) washers. Make sure that is properly fitted by giving it a shake.
